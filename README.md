# Twitter_data_type_filter
As part of my research project, I extracted the twitter data using Python from the twitter profiles of local PD's (from cities including MA towns, Reno, Rochester and Omaha) and of the local police officials. We later analyze the exctrated data to identify the variable types and variable description using functions from dply package in R.
